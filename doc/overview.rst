:Release: |release|

.. include:: ../README.rst
  :start-after:	header-start-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove
  :end-before: header-end-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove

Once the PennyLane-QuantumInspire plugin is installed and you have set up an API key for the Quantum Inspire platform, the Quantum Inspire device
can be accessed straightaway in PennyLane, without the need to import new packages.

Backends
~~~~~~~~

Currently, for the Quantum Inspire device four different backends are available:

.. title-card::
    :name: 'QX single-node simulator'
    :description: Quantum Inspire emulator run on a commodity cloud-based server, with 4GB RAM. It has a fast turn-around time for simulations up to 26 qubits. For basic users, the commodity cloud-based server will be sufficient.

.. title-card::
    :name: 'Spin-2'
    :description: Quantum Inspire quantum 2-qubit semiconductor electron spin processor.
    :link: backends/spin2.html

.. title-card::
    :name: 'Starmon-5'
    :description: Quantum Inspire quantum 5-qubit superconductor Transmon processor.

Selecting backends in Quantum Inspire device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Quantum Inspire backends specified in the previous section can be used by the Quantum Inspire device.
Selecting a specific backend for the Quantum Inspire device can be done by passing a ``backend`` argument with
the backend name:

.. code-block:: python

    dev = qml.device('quantuminspire.qi', wires=4, backend='QX single-node simulator')

PennyLane chooses the ``QX single-node simulator`` as the default backend if no backend is specified.
For more details on the ``QX single-node simulator`` and the other emulator backends, including backend capacities, see
`Quantum Inspire Emulator backends documentation <https://www.quantum-inspire.com/kbase/emulator-backends/>`_.
For more details on the Quantum Inspire hardware backends, including operations specifics for the hardware backends,
see `Quantum Inspire Hardware backends documentation <https://www.quantum-inspire.com/kbase/hardware-backends/>`_.

Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~

You can try it out using any of the qubit based `demos from the PennyLane documentation
<https://pennylane.ai/qml/demonstrations.html>`_, for example the tutorial on
`qubit rotation <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation.html>`_.
Simply replace ``'default.qubit'`` with the Quantum Inspire device ``'quantuminspire.qi'`` and a backend of your choice,
such as ``'QX single-node simulator'``.
